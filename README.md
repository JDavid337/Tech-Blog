# Tech-Blog

## Introduction

Welcome to the Tech Blog!  The Tech Blog was supposed to be a blog where you could log in and blog about technical things.  You could create an account, or sign in if you'd already created an account, view your blog posts and create new blog posts.  It was also supposed to be a place where you could comment on others blogs, or other people could blog on yours!

## Unfortunately

However, after going through not one but TWO tutors, and two different tutor sessions, reviewing with peers, asking BCS, even copying sections of code here and there, this blog was never completed.  My second tutor, after going over this assignment with him for a full tutorial session, actually strongly advised me that I skip this homework.
